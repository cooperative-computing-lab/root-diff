##ROOT DIFF

This program can be used to compare two root files. 
There are three levels of comparison 

1. logic - compare the hierarchical structure of two root files.
2. strict - root files should be logic equivalence and objects from 
two root files should be equal to each other on byte level.
3. exact - root files should be strictly equivalence and objects from 
two root files should have same timestamp.

This program can only on built on crc machines.
Before build please remove the gcc module and load the 
root, python/2.7.8 module by typing following commands:

    module rm gcc
    module load root python/2.7.8

Then you can build the program by executing

    make

After build, `root_cmp` in src/ can be used to compare the 
two root files, more details can be found through `bin/root_cmp -h`

Example:

`bin/root_cmp -f sample_root_files/f1,sample_root_files/f2`

`bin/root_cmp -l logic -f sample_root_files/f1,sample_root_files/f2`
